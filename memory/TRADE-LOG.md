# Trade Log

Every trade (entry + exit) and every EOD snapshot, appended here in
chronological order. Never edit or delete a past entry — this is an
append-only audit trail. `memory/PROJECT-CONTEXT.md`'s "Key Files" note:
tail this file for currently-open positions, their entries, and their
stops before doing anything else.

## Entry format (market-open / ad-hoc trade)

## Entry format (EOD snapshot, appended every daily-summary run)

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — EOD Snapshot (Day N, Weekday)
**Portfolio:** $X | **Cash:** $X (X%) | **Day P&L:** ±$X (±X%) | **Phase P&L:** ±$X (±X%)

## Day 0 — EOD Snapshot (pre-launch placeholder)

**Portfolio:** $10,000.00 (placeholder) | **Cash:** $10,000.00 (100%) | **Day P&L:** $0 | **Phase P&L:** $0

No positions yet. Bot has not been run against a live Alpaca account.
**The first `daily-summary` (or `pre-market`) routine to actually run MUST
replace this placeholder with the real `bash scripts/alpaca.sh account`
equity figure** — every later day-over-day P&L calculation in this file
depends on that baseline being accurate, not illustrative.
